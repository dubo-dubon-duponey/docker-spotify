# XXX Currently reduced to a single architecture to avoid using all disk space until we figure out our space efficiency problem (likely the fat builder image getting duplicated over and over)
# Solution would probably be to do like buildkit and fetch with a lightweight go image while build mount from the previous stage instead of inheriting - annoying but probably the only way
